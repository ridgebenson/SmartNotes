# SmartNotes

## About
SmartNotes is a web-based notes application built from scratch using the Django Framework. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their notes. Whether you're jotting down ideas for a novel, or keeping track of meeting minutes, SmartNotes has got you covered.

## Features
- **Create Notes:** Add new notes with a simple click. Give it a title, write your content, and save it for later.
- **Read Notes:** Browse through your notes easily. All your notes are displayed in one place for easy access.
- **Update Notes:** Made a mistake or want to add more to a note? No problem. Editing a note is just as easy as creating one.
